<h3><DD> Description</DD></h3>

<p><DD>Mount Merapi (Romanized: gunung měrapi, Indonesian: Gunung Merapi, lit. 'Fire Mountain') is an active stratovolcano located on the border between the province of Central Java and the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548. It is located approximately 28 km (17 mi) north of Yogyakarta city which has a population of 2.4 million. Thousands of people live on the flanks of the volcano, with villages as high as 1,700 m (5,577 ft) above sea level.<br><br> Smoke can often be seen rising from the mountaintop, and several eruptions have caused fatalities. A pyroclastic flow from a large explosion killed 27 people on 22 November 1994, mostly in the town of Muntilan, west of the volcano. Another large eruption occurred in 2006, shortly before the Yogyakarta earthquake. In light of the hazards that Merapi poses to populated areas, it was designated as one of the Decade Volcanoes, which are considered worthy of particular study in light of their history of large, destructive eruptions and proximity to densely populated areas. </P></DD>

<h3><DD> History </DD></h3>

<p><DD>Between 25th-26th October 2010, Mt Merapi erupted three times; thousands were evacuated from a 20km radius around the slopes of the volcano. The column of smoke rose vertically to 1.5km and pyroclastic activity began to subside, 18 people were found dead. The deaths were due to burns and respiratory problems. Between 17th-29th October 2010, the evacuation zone remained, however, lava ejection with hot ash clouds fell down the slope and travelled 3km and pressure seemed to be decreasing behind the lava dome that had formed in the crater. The death toll was now at 30. From the 30th October, Mount Merapi exploded again, this time causing a fireball to rise 2km vertically into the air from the volcano. The magma continued to push its way into the lava dome and ash fell more than 30km away. This all caused raining sand to fall 10km away. </p><DD>
